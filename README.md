The Food Ordering App is a web application that allows users to browse and order food items from various restaurants. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and React Redux, a predictable state container for managing application state.

## Features


- Restaurant Listing: Users can view a list of restaurants available on the platform, along with their menus and other details.
- Menu Navigation: Users can browse through the menu items of a selected restaurant, filter them based on categories or preferences, and add items to their cart.
- Cart Management: Users can view their cart, modify quantities, remove items, and proceed to checkout.
- Order Placement: Users can place orders for the selected items, specify delivery details, and make payments.
